## Dataset and Research questions.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tonygordonjr/spotify-dataset-2023) we decided to analyze takes into considerations all the Spotify metadata and some specific musicological analysis performed on the tracks at the year 2023. Even if it's not devised officially by Spotify the dataset curator on Kaggle states that it leverages the official [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).

Given the dimension of the dataset we could've performed a huge amount of different analysis, so we decided to narrow down the scope in order to properly fit this project requirements.

Our research aim to explore some interesting features and insight that we can extract from this dataset, they can be summarized in:

- What's artist popularity, how is it different from the number of followers and how it affects in terms of number the whole se of artists?

- What's "trendy" and what is "indie" we select, according to popularity, two population sample and study how are genres distributed, do they respect our expectations given the current musical trends?

- From this we dive into three among the main "indie" genre and study how their popularity evolve.

- How are genres distributed in general?

- How do labels work and distribute throughout popularity? Our hypothesis of a bell shaped curve is respected?
